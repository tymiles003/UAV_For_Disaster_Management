# Team "Eye in the Sky "
**We have an inter-disciplinary project going on in CFI which is in collaboration with CVI and Aero club.**

**We participated in a Hackathon called "Yet Another Hackathon 2K18" and won the runner up prize worth 10000 rupees.**

### There were three subdomains in the competition and we had to work on any one of them, these subdomains were:

* New innovation and implementation in public services (Under the domain of Governance)

* Gaming with a purpose (Under the domain of Education)

* Personal Security (Under the domain of Security)

**We chose to work on the subdomain of public services; specifically targeting Emergency Services and the use of Drones in Disaster management.**

We used real time Deep Learning and path planning algorithms in our codes:

### Our unique selling points were these:

* Doing live person detection with the help of highly optimised YOLO architecture using Tensorflow API.

* Achieving live video transfer (Drone and laptop not connected physically at all) and also sending accurate GPS coordinates to the base-station whenever a person is detected so that the relief forces can go out there and save him/her.

* Achieving live Activity Recognition for an SOS signal done by a person during a disaster (This SOS signal includes raising both your hands and waving in front of the drone continously as a sign of asking for immediate Help Requirement). Also this idea is not implemented and present on the internet till date and it is atleast 3 times faster than the fastest available method for Activity Recognition (which relies on using 3D convolution of frames across time)

* Making an interactive demo where in a user can zoom-in on the map of India and draw a rectangle around the disaster affected area after which a team of drones will go and distribute themselves in such a way so that the area survielled by the team of drones is maximum.

### Also we would like to specially thanks to the CVI club heads Lokesh Kumar and Varun Sundar who guided and helped us throughout the competition.
